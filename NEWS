gluster-block release 0.2.1 is tagged.

This release is more focused on bug fixing.


Highlights:
----------
* Implement LRU cache to hold glfs objects, this makes the cli commands run fast.
    For example on a single node,
    create command takes ~1 sec now, while it was ~5 sec before.

* Log severity level is configurable now.
    look for --log-level option of daemon and '/etc/sysconfig/gluster-blockd'

Other Notable Fixes:
-------------------
* betterments in messages on failure
* fix heap-buffer-overflow
* prevent crashes when errMsg is not set
* print human readable timestamp in log files
* improve logging at server side
* handle SIGPIPE in daemon
* update journal-data/block meta-data synchronously
* reuse port 24006 (SO_REUSEADDR) on bind
* add manual for gluster-blockd
* updated ReadMe
* and many more ...
